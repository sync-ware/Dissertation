abstract = {Health sensing through smartphones has received considerable attention in recent years because of the devices' ubiquity and promise to lower the barrier for tracking medical conditions. In this paper, we focus on using smartphones to monitor newborn jaundice, which manifests as a yellow discoloration of the skin. Although a degree of jaundice is common in healthy newborns, early detection of extreme jaundice is essential to prevent permanent brain damage or death. Current detection techniques, however, require clinical tests with blood samples or other specialized equipment. Consequently, newborns often depend on visual assessments of their skin color at home, which is known to be unreliable. To this end, we present BiliCam, a low-cost system that uses smartphone cameras to assess newborn jaundice. We evaluated BiliCam on 100 newborns, yielding a 0.85 rank order correlation with the gold standard blood test. We also discuss usability challenges and design solutions to make the system practical.},

@book{SzeliskiRichard2011CV:A,
series = {Texts in Computer Science},
abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/ Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision. Dr. Richard Szeliski has more than 25 years’ experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Research. This text draws on that experience, as well as on computer vision courses he has taught at the University of Washington and Stanford.},

abstract = {The identification of network applications through observation of associated packet traffic flows is vital to the areas of network management and surveillance. Currently popular methods such as port number and payload-based identification exhibit a number of shortfalls. An alternative is to use machine learning (ML) techniques and identify network applications based on per-flow statistics, derived from payload-independent features such as packet length and inter-arrival time distributions. The performance impact of feature set reduction, using Consistency-based and Correlation-based feature selection, is demonstrated on Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, C4.5, Bayesian Network and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes Tree algorithms. We then show that it is useful to differentiate algorithms based on computational performance rather than classification accuracy alone, as although classification accuracy between the algorithms is similar, computational performance can differ significantly.},
